# Clinic Storage â€“ Multi-Tenant Storage System

        Description:
            ResourceHub is a simple multi-tenant resource allocation system designed for businesses, schools, NGOs,
            and government offices. It helps organizations track and allocate resources such as equipment, supplies,

#             
       Functionalities (Simple CRUD-Based Features)
            1. Multi-Tenant System (One App, Multi-Database)
                Each organization (tenant) has its own database to store and manage resources.
                Super Admin oversees system-wide settings and subscriptions.
            
            2. CRUD Operations for Resource Management
                Create: Admins can add resources (e.g., office supplies, equipment) with details like name, quantity, and location.
                Read: Users can view available resources and their current status (Available, In Use, Under Maintenance).
                Update: Modify resource details, update quantity, or change status when allocated or returned.
                Delete: Remove obsolete or discarded resources.
    
            3. Resource Allocation & Tracking
                Assign resources to departments or projects.
                Track the current status resource.
                Monitor who is responsible for allocated resources.
            
            4. User Roles & Permissions
                Admin: Manages resources, assigns items, and tracks allocation.
                Employee/User: Can request resources and check availability.
